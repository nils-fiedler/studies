This is a study on facebook's "react". The task I decided to go with is 
a cluster management GUI where you can add/destroy servers and applications 
on the cluster.

I forked from their tutorial at
"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html".

Moreover I chose to use a CSS-reset as of version YUI 3.18.1 from Yahoo! Inc.
@see: http://yuilibrary.com/license/

To view the UI follow these steps:
0) if not already installed, install "node.js"
1) extract the contents of my given package
2) open a bash/cmd/etc and change to the directory where the extracted files are
3) run "npm install" to install the relevant node modules
4) then run "npm start" or "node server.js" to start the server
5) open your favorite browser and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/"
